“ Only a few a dozen NYPD members were placed on unpaid leave Monday after refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine — but thousands of unvaccinated employees remain on the job with pending exemption requests, the city’s top cop said.” - NY Post

What exactly is ‘right-wing covid denial?’ Majority of Democrats believe the hospitalization rate for covid is 50%. They have been the most uninformed party throughout this, and pushed harmful ineffective NPIs such as masks. Republicans have been mostly right on this one.

I question the fundamental objectivity of journalism 2022. Imagine Virginia as prelude to 2022.  Polling reversed in 14 days. MSM is so desirous for a major story as COVID and anti-vax chills, Is MSM creating a false flag or is Virginia Politics delivering the sad honest truth?

I guess you forgot about year 4 when he refused to procure adequate Covid testing and PPE, leaving states to search the globe and get in price wars. While Trump kept saying it would magically disappear. Economy in freefall—that’s what he left Joe.

Public Healthcare needs a much bigger budget post COVID as the decimated economy will push more patients to public hospitals and the neglect of NCDs during the pandemic means many would have progressed. 

Problem: Money to KKM doesn't enrich politicians - mostly operating costs.

Maybe they made the choice that they would rather take their chances and die free instead of under the dictators thumb. These mandates are 100% political. The vaccine neither prevents you from getting Covid or from transmitting it.
